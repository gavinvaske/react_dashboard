# Description

I'm using this repo as a playground to start a react application from scratch as some fun-ol' practice to refine my knowledge on the subjects.

## How to Run this Application Locally
  1. Run the command `npm run start`
  2. Open a browser and visit `localhost:1234`
    * All code changes will be rendered in the browser automatically without needing to refresh
